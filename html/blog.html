            <h2>The Origins of Coffee in Colombia</h2>
            <p>
                Coffee arrived in Colombia in the late 18th century, brought by Jesuit priests from the Caribbean. Its cultivation spread gradually across the country, taking root in the Andean regions where the climate and soil were ideal for growing coffee. By the mid-19th century, coffee became one of Colombia's key agricultural products.

                During the 19th and 20th centuries, Colombian coffee started to gain a strong reputation internationally. By the 1950s, Colombia had established itself as one of the world’s top coffee exporters. The creation of the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros (FNC) in 1927 helped standardize and promote the high quality of Colombian coffee abroad.
